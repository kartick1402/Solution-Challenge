### PROBLEM WE ARE SOLVING
LGBTQ stands for “Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer”. In this Project, we are focusing on the “Difficulties 
faced by LGBTQ Community” of our society.

-> The problems or issues of this community are never discussed in our society. Most people are not comfortable 
discussing about them because of their Homophobic Nature which led people of this community to conceal their 
sexuality for fear of the negative reactions and consequences of coming out.

-> People belonging to this community have to cope-up with Harassment, Abuse(Physical, Mental, even Sexual) and 
Discrimination without any support which eventually leads to negative impact on their mental health and distress.

-> There are also discrimination in work place for them which leads to their job instability or unemployment resulting them to 
beg on streets for their living.

-> A child by birth is not categorized as Lesbian or Gay etc. the hormonal changes by the age of 9-10 brings up this and at 
this age there are a lot of questions in their mind, which are either left unanswered or they don’t ask them. Teenagers 
who feel a strong attraction to persons of their own gender at first experience confusion about their feelings and sexuality.

-> Thus, our Project will give them a platform where they can connect with each other, seek guidance and get 
proper advice. They will also get answers to their queries which they have in their mind. They will also be made 
aware of their Rights and will be given JOB opportunities.

### OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION
We are building a website, which will let the people of the community gain access to the relevant and important 
information easily.

-> The website will connect them with their peers that will be guiding them. Their queries and doubts will be solved there and 
they can freely ask there anything without any fear or hesitation.

-> A separate option for Job Opportunities will be made where they will be given information regarding job opportunities in 
particular field. 

-> Dealing with any medical issues or need guidance, don’t worry a medical helpline number along with live chat support will be provided.

-> Having any specific queries don’t worry the counsellors or individuals are there for you. The website will 
connect you directly via chat with them so that you never feel alone.

### HOW OUR SOLUTION IS UNIQUE

Government initiatives are there, NGOs and other helping organizations are there but the main point is that they are not so 
easily accessible to such people, especially children who have ample of questions to ask, who are confused a lot and 
who need a safe and easily accessible platform, from where they can easily communicate and get their answers as 
many times as they want, and always feel that they are not different from our society, but are common part of it like other 
individuals. Also, it will make them aware of their Rights and will let them accept themselves as they are, without the fear
of others. 
Further, the biggest note of our project is that it motivates the people of our LGBTQ Community in a positive manner, and 
make them believe that they are same as other people. It will help them to understand what their rights are and make them 
understand that they have as equal opportunity in each field as other individuals
